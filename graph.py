* Fill out a list with traversal that will visit all rooms atleast once
* Commands:
    - player.current_room.id: This will give us the current room id
    - player.current_room.get_exits(): Will return a list of possible moves we can make
    - player.travel(directon, [boolean: wil display room info to us]): This will allow us to move / traverse rooms
* Create an array with a valid move set: We can achieve this with the player.current_room.get_exits()
* Graph Class
    - Will need a verticies attr that is a dict (complete)
        - the keys will be a room id
        - the values will be a dict, this will hold n,s,e,w whose values will be the room id for the possible move
    - The vertex will be the current room ID
    - The edges will be the rooms that the room ID connects to
    - some function: We will need the player instance passed to us so that we have a way to move around the player
    - We need a BFT fn for us to move around and traverse the map
